✅ New Feature: Robots can now move diagonally (e.g., NE3, SW2) in addition to standard directions (North, South, East, West).

This project was built using Python as part of an internship assignment, demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, validation, and state tracking.

The program prevents robots from colliding, tracks each robot’s full path, and stops movement at terrain boundaries or if the destination is occupied by another robot.
